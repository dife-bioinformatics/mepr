#' @title Function to initiate a new project
#' @description The function will create a new analysis project with pre-specified folders and files
#' @details The function initiates folders and files that demonstrate good practise, such as R folder with R files
#' in them. Furthermore, for the data, data-raw, results/figures and results/tables folders dummy files have been added
#' to keep the folder structure when collaborating with others on GitHub because those folders have otherwise been set to
#' be ignored by git (see .gitignore file). In the README.md file a very brief description of the project should be provided.
#' @param path defaults to "home". The function uses the `fs::path_expand()` functionality to find the path
#' to the home directory using the tilde expression. When this argument is changed, it
#' should be replaced with an absolute path.
#' @param name name of the new R project (and folder)
#' @return A new project will be set up at the specified location (path + name) by the user.

  #### not sure if we should keep this but it is extremely helpful for checking out to improve figures
