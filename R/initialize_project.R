#' @title Function to initiate a new project
#' @description The function will create a new analysis project with pre-
#' specified folders and files.
#' `r lifecycle::badge('experimental')`
#' @details The function initiates folders and files that demonstrate good
#' practise, such as R folder with R files in them. Furthermore, for the data,
#' data-raw, results/figures and results/tables folders dummy files have been
#' added to keep the folder structure when collaborating with others on GitHub
#' because those folders have otherwise been set to be ignored by git
#' (see .gitignore file). In the README.md file a very brief description of the
#' project should be provided.
#' @param path defaults to "home". The function uses the `fs::path_expand()`
#' functionality to find the path to the home directory using the tilde
#' expression. When this argument is changed, it should be replaced with an
#' absolute path.
#' @param name name of the new R project (and folder)
#' @return A new project will be set up at the specified location
#' (path + name) by the user.
